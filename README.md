# SymNets
Official PyTroch implementation for ["Domain-Symnetric Networks for Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CVPR 2019)"](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Zhang_Domain-Symmetric_Networks_for_Adversarial_Domain_Adaptation_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf).

# News!
An extension of this work is recently accepted by **TPAMI 2020**, including 
*  A new theoretical framework closely supports/motivates a series of algorithms, including SymNets and MCD. 
*  A algorithm improvement and an unified framework for adversarial UDA.
*  Excellent results of SymNets on tasks of partial and open set UDA.
